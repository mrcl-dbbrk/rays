# rays
**DISCLAIMER**: You probably should not rely on this software at this point. I'm just trying things out here.

This is a very primitive ray-tracer using ray-marching, written in Clojure and running on the CPU. You can move and look around using the WASD keys and the mouse, but you have to remain still for the rendering to finish.
